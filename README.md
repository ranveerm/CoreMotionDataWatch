**Note-** Large portion of this project was derived from Chapter 11 of content material from **Machine Learning by Tutorials** (https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/machine-learning-by-tutorials/v2.0), and credit goes to the original authors and raywenderlich.com. This project adapts this onto SwfitUI and provides ability to collect motion data from the watch.
